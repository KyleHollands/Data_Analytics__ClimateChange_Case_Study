# Data_Analytics__ClimateChange_Case_Study

## Pitch
The goal of this analysis is to identify trends or key indicators of climate change by first looking at the overall warming of the planet across various countries, over the past 300 years. Periods of greater increase should be prevalent within the data, where further investigation into those periods can be done to determine cause and correlation.

- What topic are you exploring?
    - The topic of this analysis is on global temperature increases.
- What is the problem you are trying to solve?
    - There isn't a particular problem trying to be solved in this case study. The aim is to identify trends or particular moments in time where global temperatures began to rise at an increasing rate. Once identified, those time periods can be further researched with the goal of determining the root causes, and possibly, if they can be mitigated.

- What metrics will you use to measure your data to achieve your objective?
    - The primary metrics for this analysis will be the average temperature for a given year by country as well as the average temperature uncertainty for that year.
    - The data was initially formatted as Months, but it does not need to be that granular. For this analysis, it has been condensed to a Year, taking the average monthly temperatures and averaging those over the year.
