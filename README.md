# Data_Analytics__ClimateChange_Case_Study

## Pitch
The goal of this analysis is to identify trends or key indicators of climate change by first looking at the overall warming of the planet across various countries, over the past 300 years. Periods of greater increase should be prevalent within the data, where further investigation into those periods can be done to determine cause and correlation.
